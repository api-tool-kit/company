# Company Story at BigCo, Inc.

### Purpose
We keep track of companies for BigCo, Inc. 

### Data
Data we include in a company record includes company name, street address, city, state/province, postal code, country, telephone, and email. Each record has a status value (pending, suspended, active, closed). We also track the date/time the record was created and the last date/time it was updated. We keep copies of the records, even after they have been deleted.

### Actions
Typical work on the company records include getting the list of company records, reading a single record, creating, updating, and deleting records. You can also update the status of a single record. Finally, you can get a filtered list of all records (support for filtering by status, by country, by state, and by company name). 

### Processing
Each company has a unique identifier in the system. Right now that is a combination of the first four letters of their company name and date the company was added to the system (in the format YYYYMMDD. We add another digit if adding that does not result in a unique identifier in the system.
